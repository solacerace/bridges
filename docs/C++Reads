If you're new to C++, it's better to pick up a book that you can easily digest. Some are too dense for newbies. 
What's good for you is something only you can decide. I linked to accu.org in previous post. 
You'll find book reviews there to help you decide.

If you aren't new, the resources I link to below will help you learn even more.

Go to the C++ subreddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/ and take a look at the sidebar.
You will find a few more resources.
Frequent that and the cpp_questions subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/ .
It's better to ask questions there than here.

Another resource is http://cppquiz.org/ .
The Programming subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/ is also very useful.
Also, https://www.bfilipek.com/ Bartek's coding blog.
http://www.1024cores.net/ - Fun with lockfree, waitfree and synchronization.
http://preshing.com/ for more C++ fun.


Kate Gregory recently updated her Pluralsight courses from what I heard on CPPCast. 
I don't know her Pluralsight courses myself, but I know from her CPPcon talks, that she must be an amazing instructor. 
In addition, on Youtube, Jason Turner does C++ Weekly videos that are awesome (each about 5 minutes long) 
- and if you know C++, find any "Modern C++" videos by Michael Caisse.
